## Quick Start

Defaults work out of the box — clone, run, configure inside the app.
Open the **Settings** panel after first login to point Odysseus at your LLM
server, search provider, email account, etc. Only touch `.env` if you need
to override deployment-level things like `AUTH_ENABLED`, `DATABASE_URL`,
or pre-seed `ODYSSEUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (otherwise an initial password is
generated and printed on first boot).

pull request guidelines.

### Option 1: Docker (recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
cp .env.example .env       # optional, but recommended for explicit defaults
docker compose up -d --build
```
Compose starts Odysseus, ChromaDB, SearXNG, and ntfy. First run does a full
image build. Open `http://localhost:7000` after the containers are healthy.
If port `7000` is already taken, set `APP_PORT=7001` (or another free port)
in `.env`, recreate the container, and open `http://localhost:7001`.

Cookbook remote servers use an Odysseus-owned SSH key from `./data/ssh`
inside Docker. In **Cookbook -> Settings -> Servers**, generate/copy the
public key and add it to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
After generating the key, you can also install it from the host with:
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i data/ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```
Cookbook local downloads are stored in `./data/huggingface`, mounted as
`~/.cache/huggingface` inside the Odysseus container. Cookbook-installed
serve engines and Python CLIs are stored in `./data/local`, mounted as
`~/.local`, so vLLM/llama.cpp installs survive container recreation.

After downloading a model, open **Cookbook -> Serve**, pick the cached model,
and launch it. When the server answers `/v1/models`, Odysseus adds it to the
chat model picker automatically. For NVIDIA / AMD GPUs in Docker, install
the host runtime (NVIDIA Container Toolkit or ROCm drivers) and enable the
matching overlay via `COMPOSE_FILE` in `.env`:

```bash
# NVIDIA
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/gpu.nvidia.yml
# AMD ROCm
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/gpu.amd.yml
```

Verify with `docker compose exec odysseus nvidia-smi -L` (or `rocm-smi`).

The default Docker image is intentionally slim. For Python-based serve engines,
use **Cookbook -> Dependencies** to install vLLM, SGLang, llama-cpp-python, or
diffusers into the persisted `./data/local` mount. Native CUDA builds inside the
container also require CUDA toolkit binaries such as `nvcc`; if those are not
installed in the container, use prebuilt Python wheels or serve from a remote
GPU host that already has the toolkit.

Useful checks:
```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=120 odysseus
docker compose logs odysseus | grep -E 'ChromaDB|MemoryVectorStore|DEGRADED'
docker compose exec odysseus python -c "from services.hwfit.models import get_models; print(len(get_models()))"
```

Expected vector-memory startup lines in Docker:
```text
ChromaDB connected: chromadb:8000
MemoryVectorStore initialized
```

The Cookbook model catalog check should print a non-zero count. If it prints
`0`, rebuild the Odysseus image with `docker compose build --no-cache odysseus`.

### Option 2: Manual install — Linux / macOS
**Requirements:** Python 3.11+. On Linux/Termux, Cookbook also requires `tmux`
for background model downloads and serves.

Install system packages first:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install tmux

# Arch
sudo pacman -S tmux

# Fedora
sudo dnf install tmux
```

Then install Odysseus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py            # creates data dirs and prints an initial admin password
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000
```

### Option 3: Manual install — Windows (PowerShell)
Windows support is not actively tested. Use it with caution; Docker on Linux
or a Linux/macOS manual install is the safer path for now.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000
```

Open `http://localhost:7000`, log in with the generated admin password,
and configure everything else inside **Settings**.

## Security Notes
Odysseus is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools: shell access, file uploads, model downloads, web research, email/calendar integrations, and API tokens. Treat it like an admin console.

- Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` for any network-accessible deployment.
- Do not expose it directly to the public internet without HTTPS and a trusted reverse proxy.
- Keep `data/`, `.env`, logs, databases, and uploaded/generated media out of Git. They are ignored by default.
- Review `data/auth.json` after first boot: disable open signup unless you intentionally want it, make only your own account admin, and keep demo/test accounts non-admin.
- Non-admin users do not get shell/Python/file read/write by default, and admin-only routes/tools such as MCP management, API tokens, webhooks, model/cookbook serving, backup/vault, and app settings are admin-gated. Other features are controlled by per-user privileges, so review each user's privileges before exposing a deployment.
- Rotate any API keys or tokens that were ever pasted into a shared chat, demo, screenshot, or log.
- If you enable API tokens or webhooks, create separate tokens per integration and delete unused ones.
- Prefer binding manual development runs to `127.0.0.1`; bind to `0.0.0.0` only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.
- Before publishing a fork, run `git status --short` and confirm no private files from `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, uploads, backups, or local databases are staged.

### Putting it behind HTTPS
Odysseus serves plain HTTP on its port. That's fine for `localhost` and trusted LAN/VPN use, but browsers will warn ("Password fields present on an insecure page") and the login + API tokens travel in cleartext. For anything reachable outside your machine — including a Tailscale IP shared with other devices — put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front.

Shortest path with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) (auto-renews Let's Encrypt certs):

```caddy
odysseus.example.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:7000
}
```

For a LAN-only Tailscale deployment, Caddy + [tailscale-cert](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#auto-https) or the built-in MagicDNS HTTPS feature both work. nginx/Traefik configs are similar — proxy `localhost:7000`, terminate TLS at the proxy. Once that's in place, the browser warning goes away and your login is encrypted.

## Contributing
Help is welcome. The best entry points are fresh-install testing, provider setup
bugs, mobile/editor polish, docs, and small focused refactors. See
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the current help-wanted list.

## Configuration
Most setup is done inside the app with `/setup` or **Settings**. Use `.env`
for deployment-level defaults and secrets you want present before first boot.
Key settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_HOST` | `localhost` | Your LLM server (e.g. `llm-host.local:8000`) |
| `LLM_HOSTS` | -- | Comma-separated list for model discovery |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | -- | Optional OpenAI key. Prefer adding providers in the app unless pre-seeding. |
| `SEARXNG_INSTANCE` | `http://localhost:8080` | SearXNG URL. Docker overrides this to `http://searxng:8080`. |
| `SEARXNG_SECRET` | generated on first Docker boot | Optional SearXNG cookie/CSRF secret. Leave blank unless you need to pin it. |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable login |
| `LOCALHOST_BYPASS` | `false` | Development-only auth bypass for loopback requests. Keep false for shared/network deployments. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/app.db` | Database connection string |
| `CHROMADB_HOST` | `localhost` | ChromaDB host for vector memory. Docker overrides this to `chromadb`. |
| `CHROMADB_PORT` | `8100` | ChromaDB port for manual host runs. Docker overrides this to `8000`. |
| `EMBEDDING_URL` | -- | OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint |

### Bundled services
Docker Compose includes these by default. The bundled service ports bind to `127.0.0.1` unless you opt in to a different bind address in `.env`, so they are reachable from the host machine but not from your LAN or the public internet by default:

  - **ChromaDB** → vector store for semantic memory. In Docker, Odysseus connects to `chromadb:8000`; from the host it is exposed as `${CHROMADB_BIND:-127.0.0.1}:8100`.
  - **SearXNG** → meta search for web search. In Docker, Odysseus connects to `searxng:8080`; from the host it is exposed as `127.0.0.1:8080`.
  - **ntfy** → local notification service, exposed as `${NTFY_BIND:-127.0.0.1}:8091`.

**Phone push notifications via ntfy:** A phone cannot subscribe to `127.0.0.1` on your server. To expose ntfy safely without opening it on every interface:

  - **Tailscale (recommended)** — set `NTFY_BIND=<tailscale-host-ip>` and `NTFY_BASE_URL=http://<tailscale-host-ip>:8091` in `.env`, recreate ntfy, then point the ntfy Android/iOS app at `http://<tailscale-host-ip>:8091/<your-topic>`.
  - **Enable ntfy auth and bind to LAN** — add `NTFY_AUTH_FILE` + `NTFY_AUTH_DEFAULT_ACCESS=deny-all` to the `ntfy` service, create a user with `docker compose exec ntfy ntfy user add ...`, then set `NTFY_BIND` to your LAN IP. See the [ntfy docs](https://docs.ntfy.sh/config/#access-control).

### Optional external services
  - **Ollama** → local LLM server -- [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)

### Ollama with Docker
If Odysseus is running in Docker and Ollama is running on the host, add the endpoint in Settings as:

`http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`

The default Compose file already maps `host.docker.internal` on Linux. Ollama also needs to listen outside its own loopback interface:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

For a systemd Ollama install, set that in the Ollama service override. If Odysseus can see Ollama but requests hang or fail, check that your host firewall allows Docker bridge traffic to port `11434`.

First-token latency is usually Ollama/model/hardware, not Odysseus. To compare, test Ollama directly:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/models
```
