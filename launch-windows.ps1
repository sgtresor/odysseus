  Odysseus - native Windows launcher (no Docker).

  One command to: create a virtualenv, install dependencies, run first-time
  setup (prints an admin password on first run), and start the server.
  Safe to re-run - it skips whatever already exists.

  Usage:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\launch-windows.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\launch-windows.ps1 -Port 7000 -BindHost 127.0.0.1

  Tip: bind 127.0.0.1 (default) for local-only use. Use 0.0.0.0 only when you
  intentionally want other devices on your LAN to reach it.
